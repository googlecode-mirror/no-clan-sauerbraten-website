	<p>Clicking on the <strong><em>READY!</em></strong> button will pass the post to admins for checking and publish.</p>
	<p>A post marked as <strong><em>pending</em></strong> means admins have not checked the post yet.</p>
	<p>If an admin edits your post (spelling, colors, images, censorship :P...), the post will return to the table as NOT READY, waiting for your aprovement (again, the <strong><em>READY!</em></strong> button).</p>
